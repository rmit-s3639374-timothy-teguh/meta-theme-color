<h2>Waiting Room</h2>
<p>Thank you for participating in this weird game. Now you will need to wait until tomorrow for the results.</p>
<p>Remember that days reset at 12:00 AM (Midnight) Australian Eastern Standard Time.</p>
<p>Please share this website to your friends. The game is better with more players.</p>
